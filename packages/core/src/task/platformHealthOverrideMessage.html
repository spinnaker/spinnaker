<p>Task not completing?</p>
<p>
  By default, Spinnaker does not consider cloud provider health (i.e. whether your instances have launched and are
  running) as a reliable indicator of instance health.
</p>
<p>
  If your instances do not provide a health indicator known to Spinnaker (e.g. a discovery service or load balancers),
  you should configure your application to consider only cloud provider health when executing tasks. This option is
  available under Application Attributes in the <b>Config tab</b>.
