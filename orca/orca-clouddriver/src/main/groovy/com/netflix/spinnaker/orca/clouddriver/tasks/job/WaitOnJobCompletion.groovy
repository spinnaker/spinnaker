   * on the job's ExecutionStatus. If it is SUCCEEDED, then an exception is thrown. Otherwise, no exception
   * is thrown since we don't want to mask the real reason behind the job failure.
   *
   * <p>If ExecutionStatus == SUCCEEDED, and especially for kubernetes run jobs, it can so happen that a user
   * has configured the job spec to run 1 pod, have completions and parallelism == 1, and
   * restartPolicy == Never. Despite that, kubernetes may end up running another pod as stated here:
   * https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/#handling-pod-and-container-failures
   * In such a scenario, it may so happen that two pods are created for that job. The first pod may still be
   * around, such as in a PodInitializing state and the second pod could complete before the first one is
   * terminated. This leads to the getFileContents() call failing, since under the covers, kubernetes job
   * provider runs kubectl logs job/<jobName> command, which picks one out of the two pods to obtain the
   * logs as seen here:
   *
   * <p>kubectl -n test logs job/test-run-job-5j2vl -c parser
   * Found 2 pods, using pod/test-run-job-5j2vl-fj8hd
   * Error from server (BadRequest): container "parser" in pod "test-run-job-5j2vl-fj8hd" is PodInitializing
   *
   * <p>That means, even if kubernetes and clouddriver marked the job as successful, since number of
   * succeeded pods >= number of completions, the kubectl command shown above could still end using
   * the failed pod for obtaining the logs.
   *
   * <p>To handle this case, if we get an error while making the getFileContents() call or if we don't receive
   *  any properties, then for kubernetes jobs, we figure out if the job status has any pod with phase
   *  SUCCEEDED. If we find such a pod, then we directly get the logs from this succeeded pod. Otherwise,
   *  we throw an exception as before.
   *
   *  <p> we aren't handling the above case for ExecutionStatus == TERMINAL, because at that point, we wouldn't
   *  know which pod to query for properties file contents. It could so happen that all the pods in such a job
   *  have failed, then we would have to loop over each pod and see what it generated. Then if say, two pods
   *  generated different property values for the same key, which one do we choose? Bearing this complexity
   *  in mind, and knowing that for succeeded jobs, this solution actually helps prevent a pipeline failure,
   *  we are limiting this logic to succeeded jobs only for now.
