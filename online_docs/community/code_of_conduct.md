# Spinnaker Community Code of Conduct

Please note that this project is released with a Contributor Code of
Conduct. By participating in this project you agree to abide by its
terms.

## Contributor Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers of this project, and in the interest
of fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect all
people who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature
requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches,
and other activities.

We are committed to making participation in this project a
harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of
experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual
orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race,
ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery
* Personal attacks
* Trolling or insulting/derogatory comments
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing each other's private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission
* Other unethical or unprofessional conduct.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit,
or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other
contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban
temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that
they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

By adopting this Code of Conduct, project maintainers commit
themselves to fairly and consistently applying these principles to
every aspect of managing this project. Project maintainers who do not
follow or enforce the Code of Conduct may be permanently removed from
the project team.

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public
spaces when an individual is representing the project or its
community.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior
may be reported by opening an issue or contacting one or more of the
project maintainers. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated
and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate
to the circumstances. Maintainers are obligated to maintain
confidentiality with regard to the reporter of the incident.

This code of conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant
([http://contributor-convenant.org](http://contributor-covenant.org)),
version 1.3.0, available at
[http://contributor-convenant.org/verson/1/3/0](http://contributor-convenant.org/verson/1/3/0).
