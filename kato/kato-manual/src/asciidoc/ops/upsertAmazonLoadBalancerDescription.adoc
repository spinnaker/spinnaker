===== Upsert Amazon Load Balancer Description

====== Key

+upsertAmazonLoadBalancerDescription+

====== Description

This description provides the inputs necessary to handle the management of an Elastic Load Balancer at Amazon. This operation will perform an "upsert" -- if an elastic load balancer by the name exists, then this process will update security groups, listeners, and health checks. If one does not exist, this process will create a new one and apply the given configuration. The desired configuration must always be supplied.

|======================
|Key               | Type   | Required | Value
|name              | string | true     | The name of the load balancer.
|availabilityZones | object | true     | An object that provides a named region to array of availability zone relationships. For example, +{ "us-east-1": ["us-east-1a", "us-east-1c"] }+ will inform the deployment engine to deploy the ELB in the "us-east-1" region, and specifically into the availability zones: "us-east-1a", "us-east-1c". AutoScaling groups within the cluster MUST ALSO be in the same zones.
|securityGroups    | array  | true     | List of security *group names*. Their IDs in their particular regions will be found at Amazon -- no need to look them up in advance.
|listeners         | array  | true     | Listeners are a construct that map ports from an ELB to a port on an instance for which the ELB is servicing. A listener is a complex object that specifies: an "externalPort" -- the port that users will hit the load balancer with; an "internalPort" -- the port that the load balancer will send the traffic to on an instance; "externalProtocol" -- the protocol that the configured "externalPort" will accept traffic. This value is one of: "HTTP", "HTTPS", "TCP", or "SSL"; "internalProtocol" -- is the protocol with which the ELB will communicate traffic to the configured "internalPort" on the instance to which it is providing service; "sslCertificateId" -- is only necessary when the "externalProtocol" is configured as "SSL". There may be any number of listeners configured.
|credentials       | string | true     | The named account credentials that are to be used for this operation.
|healthInterval    | number | false    | Configures the interval, in seconds, between ELB health checks. Default: 10
|healthTimeout     | number | false    | Configures the timeout, in seconds, for reaching the +healthCheck+ target. Default: 5
|unhealthyThreshold| number | false    | Configures the number of unhealthy observations before deservicing an instance from the ELB. Default: 2
|healthyThreshold  | number | false    | Configures the number of healthy observations before reinstituting an instance into the ELB's traffic rotation. Default: 10
|crossZoneBalancing| boolean| false    | Indicates whether this ELB should balance traffic to instances in different zones. This should be enabled unless there's a real good reason not to do this. In the case of a zone failure or problem, the ELB should be able to delegate traffic to instances in other zones. Default: true
|subnetType        | string | false    | The subnet "type" that is applicable to this deployment. This instructs the deployment engine to what subnets and vpcs this deployment will be a part. Subnets that are tagged with the key "immutable_metadata" and a value of a structure like, +{ "purpose": "internal", "target": "ec2" }+, will be found by the engine, and their "purpose" may be used as a value type for this field. Note that "purpose" and "target" provide a composite key, where the "target" property has eligible values of one of: "ec2" or "elb". Only one "purpose" to "target" correlation is valid with respect to the "subnetType" field in this description.
|healthCheck       | string | false    | Specifies the health check target for this load balancer. Right now, this is just a pass-thru of what Amazon expects for an ELB health check's "target".
