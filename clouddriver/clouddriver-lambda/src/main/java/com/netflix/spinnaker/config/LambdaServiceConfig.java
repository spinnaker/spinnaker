/**
 * The "defaults" here apply to ALL AWS Lambda operations. Several settings on AWS operations have
 * interesting precedents. Examples below:
 *
 * <p>IF timeout is set on the pipeline that is BELOW the defaults that timeout will win, UNLESS
 * it's greater than the global timeout. Whoever is the MOST restrictive wins on timeouts.
 *
 * <p>Retry policy is different. A retry here of -1 is the default, which delegates to the RETRY
 * policy which tries to make intelligence decisions on whether it SHOULD retry (500's or timeouts
 * are generally retry situations) IF instead of trying to deterministically retry, you can set this
 * to a set value which will then determine how many retry attempts to make WITH the same policy
 * restrictions. See the {@link AmazonClientProvider.Builder#buildPolicy()} build policy method for
 * the default policy.
 *
 * <p>{@link
 * com.netflix.spinnaker.clouddriver.lambda.deploy.description.InvokeLambdaFunctionDescription}
 * operation. These are JUST defaults and nominally set higher so you can lower them PER request.
