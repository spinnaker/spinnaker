+upsertSecurityGroupDescription+

====== Description

This description supplies the inputs necessary to define an Amazon Security Group. This is an "upsert" operation, meaning that if no security group exists in the specified region, then one will be created. The operation that utilizes this description will make the state of the security group reflect the supplied description. Permissions will not be appended to a security group, they will be reset and reapplied for each subsequent request.

NOTE: This operation will remove all existing ingress permissions before applying those supplied in this description.
