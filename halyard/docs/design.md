# Architecture

In order to understand how Halyard will tackle the problems we will describe
below, it is valuable to have a mental model of how it will be architected.

Since we want to provide both a generic interface to make configuration
requests against, without commiting to requiring a CLI, a web UI, a packaged
library, etc... we will start by writing Halyard as a daemon, listening to 
requests on port 8064<sub>[1](#footnotes)</sub>. This allows the content of 
those requests to be generated by a user-friendly interface or library which 
will be described in a separate document.

# Goals and Solutions

Currently, it is not easy to setup and operate non-trivial installations of
[Spinnaker](https://github.com/spinnaker/spinnaker). It requires knowledge of
the behavior and operation of many independently configured services - and even
with that knowledge - there is no existing solution for distributing or
valdating configuration, updating Spinnaker's stateful services, or interacting
with Spinnaker's API outside of the prebuilt UI. The goal of Halyard
is to provide a solution for all of this. To understand what Halyard will
become, and how it will address these problems, we will separate the
concerns of Halyard into two stages.

- 1) [Configuring Spinnaker](#1-configuring-spinnaker)

- 2) [Deploying and Updating Spinnaker](#2-deploying-and-updating-spinnaker)

Since this document focuses only on the Halyard daemon, it won't be immediately
clear what the value the config files documented here bring to the user, since
the end goal is to simplify config after all, not create more of it. However,
these files are really meant to be read and modified only by the daemon,
whereas the user would modify their config with a series of commands like this:

```
$ hal add-account --help
You need to specify
   --provider (kubernetes, aws, or google)
   --name (a human readable name for this account)
as well as some provider specific information you will be prompted for.
$ hal add-account --provider kubernetes --name prod
The kubernetes provider requires
   --context
$ hal add-account --provider kubernetes --name prod --context <TAB><TAB>
gke_us-central-1       gke_us-east-1   # tab completed entries
gke_us-west-1          gke_us-east-2
$ hal add-account --provider kubernetes --name prod --context gke_us-central-1
Account added validated & added successfully.
$ hal add-account --provider kubernetes --name prod --context gke_us-central-3
Account "prod" could not be added:
  - Context "gke_us-central-3" is not a valid entry in ~/.kube/config.
  - Account "prod" for provider "kubernetes" already exists.
$ hal list-accounts --provider kubernetes
- prod
- staging
- test
$ hal update --service clouddriver
Updating clouddriver configuration...
Creating new clouddriver cluster...
Spinning down old clouddriver cluster...
Update successful
```

Previously, the update path has failed for users in the following places:

- A) Understanding all of the configuration options availabe to the Kubernetes
  provider (there are at least 10 or so) after finding the correct
  documentation.

- B) Understanding how to add multiple accounts to Spinnaker (this comes up
  weekly in the slack channel).

- C) Realizing that they have to edit `clouddriver-local.yaml` rather than
  `spinnaker-local.yaml`, because only the former supports multiple accounts
  per-provider.

- D) Validating that the context they have chosen actually works. This
  wouldn't be discovered until after clouddriver has been restarted, and the
  account fails to show up with an error message deep inside the logs.

These are common issues that happen with each provider, and provide a serious
user experience problem when running Spinnaker. Halyard's objective is
to programatically overcome these issues.

## 1) Configuring Spinnaker

The first stage in Halyards development will involve three parts.

- 1.1) [Versioning Spinnaker](#11-versioning-spinnaker)

- 1.2) [Distributing Authoritative
   Configuration](#12-distributing-authoritative-configuration)

- 1.3) [Generating User Configuration](#13-generating-user-configuration)

  - [`~/.hal` Contents](#hal-contents)

  - [`~/.hal` Semantics](#hal-semantics)

  - [`~/.hal` Example](#hal-example)

  - [Halyard Interface](#halyard-interface)

### 1.1) Versioning Spinnaker

In order to have confidence in the Spinnaker installation being deployed, we
need to pin specific versions of Spinnaker microservices, as well as the
dependencies they require in a Bill of Materials (BOM).  We propose that the
schema looks like this:

```yaml
version: 1.4.0
services:                   # one entry for every service
  clouddriver:
    version: 1.320.0        # corresponds to travis-ci spinnaker release
    dependencies:           # list of name/version pairs
      - name: redis
        version: >2.0       # it is worth exploring version ranges here
  orca: ...
```

While the first iteration of Halyard development (configuring Spinnaker) will
not be able to deploy Spinnaker with the specified versions, it is important
that we pin sets of Spinnaker configuration to sets of Spinnaker service
versions by means of a single version number.

This BOM should never need to exist on any machine deploying or running
Spinnaker, as it only needs to be readable by Halyard at
deployment/configuration time, meaning it could be hosted at a publicly
readable web endpoint. However, the Spinnaker version itself will be present on
whatever machine is running Halyard to inform it of what configuration to read
and what to deploy.

The key takeaway here is that a Spinnaker version points to a BOM, and that 
Halyard therefore only needs the Spinnaker version to determine the version of 
all its dependencies

### 1.2) Distributing Authoritative Configuration

The idea is to have a single place that shared, authoritative Spinnaker
configuration can be downloaded from. This will ultimately replace the
configuration in
[spinnaker/config](https://github.com/spinnaker/spinnaker/tree/master/config)
by storing each `*.yaml` file in a single versioned bucket (S3/GCS). The bucket 
version will be mapped to a Spinnaker version to make it simple for Halyard to 
fetch the correct configuration. The actual set of configuration will never 
need to be stored on the maching running Halyard, only staged there during 
distribution of the configuration. This configuration (alongside user edits) 
will be placed baked into the VMs running Spinnaker services.

### 1.3) Generating User Configuration

This will be the most challenging part of Halyard's first phase of development.
In order to do this correctly, let's first list some goals:

- a) The user should never have to open a text editor to write or edit
  Spinnaker confiuration

- b) If the user does want to hand-edit configuration, Halyard should not
  interfere with that (but it will be an advanced use-case, and shall be
  treated as such).

- c) Halyard should enable a user to configure multiple instances of Spinnaker
  all from the same machine.

- d) It should be easy to extend Halyard to accept new config options.

To achieve these goals, Halyard will take a two-step approach to generating
Spinnaker configuration:

- a) Receive a number of user commands (add an account, add a trigger, etc...)
  and store the resulting output in the `~/.hal/config` file.

- b) Reading configuration from `~/.hal/config` and from the specified
  Spinnaker version, write out all Spinnaker configuration to `~/.spinnaker` 
  (the default configuration directory).

Before exploring the semantics of the individual Halyard commands, let's look
at the `~/.hal` directory.

#### `~/.hal` Contents

The directory structure will look something like this:

```
.hal/
  config                     # all halyard spinnaker entries
  spinnaker-api-team/        # optional directory with per-spinnaker config
    clouddriver-local.yaml   # optional -<profile>.yaml files with overrides
  spinnaker-ml-team/
    clouddriver-local.yaml
```

The takeaway for the above diagram is that only `~/.hal/config` is required and
read by Halyard, and that for each separate installation of Spinnaker you can
optionally provide your own `*-<profile>.yaml` files for further configuration.
The things configured in these `*-<profile>.yaml` files should _not_ conflict
with any configured in the below `~/.hal/config`.

The contents of `~/.hal/config` will look like this:

```yaml
halyard-version: 1.0.0
current-deployment: spinnaker-api-team # which deployment to operate on
deployment-configuration:
  - name: spinnaker-api-team
    version: 1.4.0                     # Spinnaker version
    providers: &clouddriver            # anchor referenced in clouddriver.yaml
      kubernetes:                      # provider-specific details
        enabled: true
        accounts:
          - name: my-kubernetes-account
            context: ...
          - name: my-other-kubernetes-account
      google: &google
        enabled: false
        accounts:
          - name: ...
    webhooks: &igor                    # anchor referenced in igor.yaml
      jenkins:                         # CI-specific details
        enabled: true
        accounts:
          - name: cloudbees
            address: ...
  - name: spinnaker-ml-team
    accounts: ...
```

The [anchors](http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2765878) referenced
above (e.g. `&clouddriver`) there will reference entries in each canned
`*.yaml` file like so:

```yaml
# clouddriver.yaml
<<: *clouddriver        # This merges all clouddriver entries in ~/.hal/config
```

#### `~/.hal` Semantics

Now that we know what will be stored in the `~/.hal` directory, we need to
explain how to generate the contents of the `~/.spinnaker` directory.

- a) For the current deployment (selected by `current-deployment` in
  `~/.hal/config`), Halyard will download all configuration for
  the given version number, and prepend the `current-deployment`'s
  `deployment-configuration` into each canned configuration file (e.g.
  `clouddriver.yaml`).

- b) Halyard will copy the entries in `~/.hal/<deployment>/*-<profile>.yaml`
  into `~/.spinnaker`.

---

Notice that so far we have just defined a more general `spinnaker-local.yaml`,
which alone is not interesting. The reason this is necessary is that
`spinnaker-local.yaml` prevented us from refering to nested dictionaries in
the way the anchors in conjunction with `~/.hal/config` do now. With this in
place, we can fully configure Spinnaker's core options (providers, git,
webhooks, etc...) in a centralized file. The ability to add additional
`*-<profile>.yaml` files exists only to cover config options that are very
unlikely to be touched by users of Spinnaker.

#### `~/.hal` Example

To drive home the interaction of the `*-<profile>.yaml` files, the
`~/.hal/config` files, and the CVM consider the following example:

We have the following directory structure:

```
.hal/
  config
  spinnaker-api-team/
    clouddriver-local.yaml
```

```yaml
# ~/.hal/config
halyard-version: 1.0.0
current-deployment: spinnaker-api-team
deployment-configuration:
  - name: spinnaker-api-team
    version: 1.4.0
    providers: &clouddriver
      kubernetes:
        enabled: true
        accounts:
          - name: my-kubernetes-account
            context: gke_1
```

```yaml
# ~/.hal/spinnaker-api-team/clouddriver-local.yaml
redis:
  scheduler: sort
```

And with a canned clouddriver configuration:

```yaml
# clouddriver.yaml 
# spinnaker v1.4.0

<<: *clouddriver
# ... lots of details
```

When Halyard generates this config, it creates the following `~/.spinnaker`
directory.

```
.spinnaker/
  clouddriver.yaml
  clouddriver-local.yaml
  orca.yaml
  gate.yaml
  rosco.yaml
  ... # remaining services.yaml
```

With the contents of `clouddriver-local.yaml`:

```yaml
# ~/.spinnaker/clouddriver-local.yaml
redis:
  scheduler: sort
```

And the contents of `clouddriver.yaml`:

```yaml
# clouddriver.yaml 
# spinnaker v1.4.0

providers: &clouddriver
  kubernetes:
    enabled: true
    accounts:
      - name: my-kubernetes-account
        context: gke_1

<<: *clouddriver
# ... lots of details
```

#### Halyard Interface

Halyard will only ever make changes to `~/.hal/config`, leaving it up to the
user to make optional changes to `~/.hal/<spinnaker-deployment>/*`. Below is 
a list of HTTP methods to be taken against the Halyard daemon by a client.

| METHOD   | PATH `/<version>/<deployment>/<type>/<name>` | BODY | DESCRIPTION |
|----------|----------------------------------------------|------|-------------|
| `POST`   | `/accounts` | account description | create new account |
| `POST`   | `/webhooks` | webhook description | create new webhook |
| `PUT`    | `/enabled` | boolean | enable/disable account |
| `PUT`    | `/enabled` | boolean | enable/disable webhook |
| `PUT`    | `/accounts/<account>` | account description | edit account |
| `PUT`    | `/webhooks/<webhook>` | account description | edit webhook |
| `DELETE` | `/accounts/<account>` | | delete account |
| `DELETE` | `/webhooks/<webhook>` | | delete webhook |
| `GET`    | `*` | | return everything matching this path |

> `<version>`: Halyard version.
>
> `<deployment>`: Name of the spinnaker deployment.
>
> `<type>`: (`provider`|`webhook`|`git`).
>
> `<name>`: name of `provider`, `webhook`, or `git` entry.

Once an incoming change has been processed, the resulting config will always be
run through a validator to ensure that Spinnaker can still be deployed with
what's been provided. If the validator passes, the configuration is written out
to `~/.spinnaker`, as described above. If it fails, the operation will be
rejected with an error message describing why.

## 2. Deploying and Updating Spinnaker

See [this document](./deploys.md)

# Non Goals

- 1) Replace the Gate API. However, it may be worth having the Halyard CLI
  provide some very rudimentary operations for starting & examining pipeline
  state.
